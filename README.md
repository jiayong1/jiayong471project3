The program will convert all the training set images to 50px * 50px. 
And the program will get the error about “.DS_Store” when you try to remove or change the file in Data folder, remove the file described in the error will fix that. 
For example, 
OSError: cannot identify image file 'Data/01/.DS_Store'

Remove the Data/01/.Ds_Store will fix it
